# Lib App

### Sypnosis
Oof.  Rails.  Not my strong suit.  I went slow and made sure that I understood how things were supposed to work, and stuff still broke.  Go figure.  Managed to kinda figure out how to implement CSS over the top of Ruby, but then started reading the SASS docs.  Next time, I'll just set up SASS files instead.

### Installation
Ruby on Rails, ```rails s``` to get your server up.

check out ```localhost3000``` in your browser
